/**
 * Security Score — 0-100 continuous readiness metric.
 *
 * Formula: start at 100, subtract per-finding penalties by severity, floor at 0.
 * Deterministic: same input findings → same output every time (no randomness,
 * no time-based variance). Penalties are exported constants so they can be
 * tuned without touching the algorithm.
 *
 *   CRITICAL  -25   (one finding immediately signals serious posture risk)
 *   HIGH      -10
 *   MEDIUM    -3
 *   LOW       -1
 *   INFO/UNKNOWN  0   (informational; no penalty)
 *
 * Intended to sit alongside (not replace) the binary PASS/FAIL gate.
 * The gate still controls CI exit code; the score provides a continuous
 * signal suitable for charting, trending, and demo alongside LuxFaber ARO
 * and Lucen Score.
 *
 * Rule version: "v1"
