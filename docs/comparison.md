## Where each tool wins

### SecGate wins when
- You want **one command** that runs five scanners and gives one verdict.
- You need **local, offline, self-hosted** scanning with no SaaS account.
- You want **zero lock-in** — every scanner is independently installable.
- You want **zero telemetry** by default.
- You're a solo founder / small team and can't afford Snyk seats.

### Snyk wins when
- You need a **managed vulnerability database** with triage workflow, Jira sync, and dashboards.
- You have budget for seats and want **vendor-backed** exploit prioritization.
- You need **runtime monitoring** (Snyk Runtime) beyond CI-time scanning.

### Trivy (standalone) wins when
- You need **deep container image scanning** — SecGate does not scan image layers today.
- You're only scanning containers and don't need SAST/secrets in the same pass.

### Semgrep OSS wins when
- You need **custom static analysis rules** (Semgrep's DSL is best-in-class).
- SAST is your only requirement.

### Aikido wins when
- You want a **SaaS dashboard** with triage workflow across scanners, and are OK with cloud-hosted.
- You want vendor-managed rule updates and exploit prioritization.

## Unique Value Proposition

**SecGate's niche: zero-config bundled orchestration.**

Every other tool on this list either:
- Does one thing (Semgrep = SAST only; Trivy standalone = container/IaC only), forcing you to wire together multiple tools yourself, **or**
- Bundles many scanners behind a SaaS account with telemetry, seat caps, and lock-in (Snyk, Aikido).

SecGate is the only option that:

1. **Bundles five best-in-class OSS scanners** behind one CLI.
2. **Requires zero config** — `npx @tinydarkforge/secgate .` runs everything.
3. **Ships no telemetry, no account, no dashboard** — output is local files.
4. **Stays MIT-licensed and free forever** — no seat caps, no commercial restrictions.
5. **Produces one normalized report** — one JSON schema, one HTML file, across all scanners.

If you need SaaS-grade triage workflow, buy Snyk or Aikido. If you need a CI gate that blocks critical issues without a sales call, use SecGate.

## Honest limitations vs paid tools

Paid SAST/SCA vendors invest heavily in:

- **Exploit prioritization** — weighing CVEs by known-exploited status (KEV), reachability analysis, EPSS scores. SecGate uses severity only.
- **Curated rule packs** — Semgrep Pro rules, Snyk's proprietary rule DB. SecGate uses OSS rules only.
- **Auto-fix across ecosystems** — Snyk can PR-fix Python, Java, Go. SecGate auto-fixes Node only (see [ADR-0002](adr/0002-npm-only-auto-fix.md)).
- **Triage UX** — dashboards, ignore policies, developer assignment. SecGate is CLI + files only.

These are real gaps. If they matter to your org, a paid tool is the right buy. SecGate is for teams that prefer **boring, owned, local tooling** over SaaS.
